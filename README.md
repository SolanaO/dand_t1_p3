# Investigate the TMDb movie dataset

## Overview

This dataset contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). This data was processed by Udacity from The Movie Database on Kaggle.

We are going to investigate how various factors (such as budget, release time, genre, etc.) influence the revenue and the ratings of movies.

## Description

The work is done in Jupyter Notebook, using a kernel provided by Udacity. The code is written in Python 3, using Pandas and NumPy. 

First, the data is assessed, cleaned and formatted. Secondly, exploratory data analysis is performed and visualizations are constructed. These are designed to investigate the following questions:
* Is a certain genre associated to higher popularity?
* What is the relation between popularity and vote average?
* Do popular movies receive better vote average?
* How does the frequency of genres vary over time?
* For a particular genre, how do the ratings vary over time?
* What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues? 

And a brief outline of our foundings. The Action and Adventure movies are the most popular genres. The most popular movies tend to receive better viewer average ratings. Regarding the evolution of genres over years, there was a high proportion of Drama movies released in the period 1960 - 1980. After 1990 the released movies mostly fall in one of the categories Comedy, Drama or Action. The most popular movies generate higher revenues, but they receive average vote ratings. A large budget does not usually guarantee a high revenue.
